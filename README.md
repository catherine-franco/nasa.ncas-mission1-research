Technical Score Earned: 38/40 (95%), Qualified for <ins> Mission 2: Explore </ins> (Accepted).

# Overview

This repository showcases the final infographic project created as part of NASA NCAS Mission 1: Discover. The initiative focused on researching and analyzing NASA's Mission Directorates, including Space Exploration Systems Development (SDMD), Space Operations and Technology (SOMD/STMD), and Science and Aeronautics (SMD/ARMD). By researching into these directorates, the goal was to explore NASA's key missions and technological advancements, highlighting their contributions to the broader objectives of the agency. This final project, *The Lunar Gateway: STMD*, served as a culmination of various preparatory research reports that involved identifying critical goals, contributions, and technologies associated with a chosen mission within one directorate.

### Mission Timeline
- Mission 1: Completed Septemer 10, 2024.
- Mission 2: October 23-30, 2024.
- Mission 3: TBD.

# Selected Mission Directorate and Mission

For this project, the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) was selected, a division focused on enabling NASA’s future missions by developing pioneering technologies. Within this directorate, the infographic highlights the Lunar Gateway mission, a cornerstone of NASA’s Artemis program. By exploring STMD's contributions to lunar exploration, this project aims to underline the importance of innovation and technology advancement in making human exploration of the Moon and beyond possible.

## Project Components

### 1. Mission Research
Detailed research was conducted on the Lunar Gateway mission, which serves as a crucial component of NASA's Artemis program. This mission supports long-term lunar exploration by providing a platform for scientific research and enabling sustainable operations on the Moon.

### 2. Mission Components
The infographic explores:
- Past: Early lunar technology missions that laid the groundwork for Artemis.
- Present: Key technologies in use today for construction and operation.
- Future: Advanced technological developments that will support deep space exploration beyond the Moon.

### 3. Career Focus
This project highlights the role of a **Systems Engineer** within STMD, showcasing how this position is critical to the overall success of NASA missions. They provide the technical expertise required to bridge the gap between conceptual designs and fully operational missions.

# Reflection

This final infographic project represents a culmination of weeks of research, feedback, and revision. It highlights the value of NASA’s mission directorates, the critical technological innovations that drive space exploration, and the careers that support these missions. By participating in the NCAS Mission 1: Discover program, I gained a deeper understanding of how NASA’s mission directorates contribute to its overall objectives and how technological advancements are essential to the future of space exploration.
